- 👋 Hi, I’m @daniel-haycraft
- 👀 My hobbies are snowboard, gaming, and figuring out how to debug my own code🤣
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and have a intermediate grasp on vanilla js.
- 🥶 Currently enrolled in the devMountaint full-time SWE python program. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that either involves python or js(my two strengths), feel free to message me even if you just need debuging help, remember 4 eyes are better than one😎
- 📫 Reach me here dhcopy1@gmail.com
